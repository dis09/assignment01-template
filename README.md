# First Assignment

## Resources

- description of the youtube dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
- pandas cheat sheet: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf
- formulas for statistics: http://www.mtreiber.de/statistikFormelnTabellen/statistikFormelsammlung.pdf
- interactive challenges for learning pandas: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas

## ToDo

- Solve the programming exercises listed in [`EXERCISES.md`](/EXERCISES.md).
- Test your code locally by running `python -m pytest` (or `py -m pytest`) in the command line from the root directory of this repository.
- Write a *short* report inside [`REPORT.md`](/REPORT.md). The report should include a description of important parts from the code (if any), whether and why some test cases failed and a short interpretation of the results.

## General remarks

- You earn points by solving exercises and by writing a short report. In total, you can make more than 100 points but for the best grade you only need 100 points. The rest counts as a bonus for the next assignment.
- Exercises that do not pass the provided test cases give zero points.
- Please use your personal private GitHub classroom repository to work on this assignment.
- Make comments to your code and provide useful commit messages.
- Don't change the file structure of the repository (e.g., by adding or deleting files).
- Help for the assignment will be provided during the exercise classes on March 15 (Group A) and March 16 (Group B).


## Happy coding! :computer::grimacing::sweat_drops::smile:
